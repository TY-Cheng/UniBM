## README

The Python scripts and the Jupyter Notebook (`vignette.ipynb`) in this repository are developed for extreme value statistical analysis.

Users are encouraged to refer to the accompanying paper for detailed method explanations and applications of these functions.

All bug reports and feature requests are welcomed.

The scripts are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3 (LGPL-3.0).
